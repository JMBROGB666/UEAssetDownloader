<h1>Unofficial Unreal Marketplace Downloader</h1>

<strong><pre>This is a work in progress.</pre></strong>

This project is an unofficial Marketplace downloader for <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/">Unreal Engine </a> for those who Hate Epic Games (apart from UE) and don't want to have to download EGL to download assets from the UE Marketplace and for those on <strong>Linux</strong>.

Platforms: Windows & Linux.

<h2>Features</h2>

The Manager is incomplete; however, it should be able to preform most of the important tasks (Downloading Assets!).

It download and install assets and plugins from the <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/store">UE Marketplace</a>.

Two-factor support has not yet been tested.
